Welcome to the course webpage for CS294: Decisions, Learning and Games. 

This course introduces students to the mathematical foundation of learning in the presence of strategic and societal agency. This is a theory-oriented course that will draw from the statistical and computational foundations of machine learning, computer science, and economics. As a research-oriented course, a range of advanced topics will be explored to paint a comprehensive picture of classical and modern approaches to learning for the purpose of decision making. These topics include foundations of learning, foundations of algorithmic game theory, cooperative and non-cooperative games, equilibria and dynamics, learning in games, information asymmetries, mechanism design, and learning with incentives. Assigned classwork includes written proof-based homework assignments, participation in discussions and peer evaluations, scribing and contributing to creating enrichment material, and research projects.
