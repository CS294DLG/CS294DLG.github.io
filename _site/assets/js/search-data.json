This course introduces students to the mathematical foundation of learning in the presence of strategic and societal agency. This is a theory-oriented course that will draw from the statistical and computational foundations of machine learning, computer science, and economics. As a research-oriented course, a range of advanced topics will be explored to paint a comprehensive picture of classical and modern approaches to learning for the purpose of decision making. These topics include foundations of learning, foundations of algorithmic game theory, cooperative and non-cooperative games, equilibria and dynamics, learning in games, information asymmetries, mechanism design, and learning with incentives. Assigned classwork includes written proof-based homework assignments, participation in discussions and peer evaluations, scribing and contributing to creating enrichment material, and research projects.

    "title": "Homework Information and Policy",
    "content": "Homework Information and Policy There will be six written assignments. Written assignments will involve deriving and proving mathematical results and critically analyzing material that is presented in class. Each homework counts for 7% of your final grade. 8% reserved for peer grading. In general, written assignments are posted on Tuesdays and are due on Thursdays (the week after). The exception to this is homework 0 that is shorter and is due on a Tuesday. Homeworks will be peer-graded, under the supervision of TA Abhishek Shetty. Each student is required to sign up for grading 1 homework at the beginning of the semester (about 5-7 student-graders per homework). A one-hour grading session will be organized by Abhishek which the student-graders are required to attend. The grading key and all other information will be released in this session and the student-graders will grade a few samples under the supervision of the TA. All grading is to be completed by the grading deadline indicated in the table below. We expect this will take about 3-5 hours of student time in the semester. Homework Policy . | Homeworks should be typeset using LaTeX. | You have a budget of five late days (i.e., 24 hour periods after the time the assignment was due) throughout the semester for which there is no late penalty. Beyond this five-day budget, assignments turned in late will be charged a one percentage point reduction of the cumulated final homework grade for each period of 24 hours for which the assignment is late. No assignment will be accepted after the solution is made public, which is typically 2 days after its due date. No late days can be used for homework 0. Regrade requests can be submitted up to seven days after the grades are released. | You can discuss the homework with other students in the class, but all final submitted work must be done entirely on your own, without looking at any notes or pictures from the work you did during discussions with other students. Be sure to mention your collaborators’ names and student IDs in your writeup. | You may use publicly available material to enrich your understanding of the course material, but you are not allowed to look up solutions to homework problems or use online software or forums for the purpose of solving the homework problems. | You must sign up to participate in peer-grading for one homework assignment at the beginning of the semester. The TA will oversee this process and the final grade will be to their discretion. | . ",

Every student will be responsible for scribing one lecture. Scribing is worth 7% of your final grade. No scribing is needed for the first lecture. A form will be posted to sign up students for scribing after that period. A lecture will generally be scribed by 1-2 students. The first draft of the scribed notes are due two work days after the corresponding lecture, i.e Tuesday lecture notes are due on Thursday and Thursday lecture notes are due on the following Monday. You will receive feedback on this draft. The final scribed notes should incorporate the instructors’ feedback and are due within two work days after the initial draft. ",
